# SOC-prediction
Abstract: State of charge (SOC) estimation is of great significance for the safe operation of lithium-ion battery (LIB) packs. Improving the accuracy of SOC estimation results and reducing the algorithm complexity are important for the state estimation. For the purpose of this report, we discuss and explore around the use of Kalman Filter for prediction of SoC of batteries â€“ implementation, results, advantages and disadvantages
